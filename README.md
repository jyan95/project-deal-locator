Welcome to dealpal - a mobile optimized web app built with JS React frontend and Ruby on Rails backend

## Description
dealpal is an app designed to help locate and keep track of deals based on user location

As a user, you can find deals near you either from the map, or from the search / browse tab, and navigate to their websites without signing in. If you sign up / sign in, you can add deals to keep track of - which you can see in your cart / basket tab. 

Signing in also gives you the ability to add markers to the map that other users will be able to see. You can see deals you've added and remove them from your profile tab.
